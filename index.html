            <h3>It's never too early to start learning!</h3>
            <p>At Indigenous Coders Collective (ICC), we believe in the power of early education to shape the future.
                Our mission is to empower indigenous youth by providing them with the tools and training they need to
                succeed in the digital world. Through our three-week summer camp program, we offer hands-on learning
                experiences in web development, covering essential skills in HTML, CSS, and more. By fostering a
                supportive and inclusive environment, ICC aims to bridge the digital divide and inspire the next
                generation of indigenous tech leaders. Join us in nurturing creativity, innovation, and
                confidence—because it's never too early to start learning!</p>
